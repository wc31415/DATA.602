# DATA 602 Course Project

The Brooklyn dataset was created from the NYC Local Law 84 Energy and Water Data Disclosure and data from the NYC Solar Map.

2013 LL84 Energy and Water Data Disclosure (Data for Calendar Year 2012)

Also available on NYC Open Data

NYC Solar Map
* http://www.nycsolarmap.com/

From the LL84 dataset (for calendar year 2012), I focused on complete entries for properties in Brooklyn.

* Street Number
* Street Name
* Zip Code
* Emissions - converted from metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) to pounds (lbs)
* Property Type

I combined those selected properties with data from the NYC Solar Map.

* Break Even - number of years until the rooftop photovoltaic system breaks even
* Energy Production - measured in kilowatt hours per year (kWh/yr) 
* Savings - measured in dollars per year ($/yr)
* Emissions Reduction - measured in pounds per year (lbs/yr)
* Trees - number of trees planted that would be the equivalent of the greenhouse gas reduction

This map displays summaries for zip codes in Brooklyn for potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
reductions if rooftop photovoltaic solar energy systems were installed.

It also displays which zip code has the highest concentration of GHG emissions, the highest GHG
emissions reduction potential (by proportion), the highest GHG emissions reduction potential
(by number), the highest energy production potential from rooftop photovoltaic systems, and
the highest savings potential from energy production.
