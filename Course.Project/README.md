NYC Solar Map

From the LL84 dataset (for calendar year 2012), I focused on complete entries for properties in Brooklyn.

* [Street Number]
* [Street Name]
* [Zip Code]
* [Emissions (converted from M to pounds/year)]
* [Property Type]

I combined those selected properties with data from the NYC Solar Map.

* [System Size]
* [Cost]
* [Cost Reduced]
* [Break Even (years)]
* [Energy Production ()]
* [Savings]
* [Emissions Reduction]
* [Trees]
