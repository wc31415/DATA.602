NYC Solar Map

From the LL84 dataset (for calendar year 2012), I focused on complete entries for properties in Brooklyn.

* Street Number
* Street Name
* Zip Code
* Emissions - converted from metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) to pounds (lbs)
* Property Type

I combined those selected properties with data from the NYC Solar Map.

* Break Even - number of years until the rooftop photovoltaic system breaks even
* Energy Production - measured in kilowatt hours per year (kWh/yr) 
* Savings - measured in dollars per year ($/yr)
* Emissions Reduction - measured in pounds per year (lbs/yr)
* Trees - number of trees planted that would be the equivalent of the greenhouse gas reduction
